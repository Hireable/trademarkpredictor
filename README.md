# TrademarkPredictor: AI-Powered Trademark Opposition Analysis

TrademarkPredictor is an advanced machine learning system designed to revolutionize how legal professionals analyze trademark opposition decisions. By combining cutting-edge natural language processing with sophisticated vector search capabilities, it transforms complex legal documents into structured, actionable data.

## Understanding How It Works

TrademarkPredictor operates through a carefully orchestrated pipeline that combines several AI technologies:

1. **Document Processing Engine**: At its core, the system uses streaming PDF processing to handle even the largest legal documents efficiently. Rather than loading entire documents into memory, it processes them in chunks, making it scalable for any document size.

2. **Intelligent Text Analysis**: The system employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the accuracy of its analysis. This means it doesn't just read the document; it understands it in the context of similar cases it has processed before.

3. **Advanced AI Integration**: We leverage Google's Vertex AI Gemini model for deep text comprehension, combined with specialized embedding models for creating precise document representations. This dual approach ensures both detailed understanding and efficient retrieval.

## Key Features and Benefits

Our system provides several sophisticated capabilities that set it apart:

### Document Processing Excellence
- **Streaming Architecture**: Process documents of any size without memory constraints
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Automatically splits documents while preserving context and legal meaning
- **Concurrent Processing**: Utilizes modern async patterns for optimal performance

### Advanced Analysis Capabilities
- **Structured Information Extraction**: Converts unstructured legal text into well-organized JSON data
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures extracted data maintains consistent structure and quality
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Adapts to new document formats through example-based learning

### Vector Search Infrastructure
- **Dual-Index Architecture**: Maintains separate indexes for document chunks and metadata
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Enables lightning-fast similarity searches across large document collections
- **Flexible Querying**: Supports both semantic and metadata-based searches

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before installation, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Access to Google Cloud Platform with Vertex AI enabled
- A Pinecone account for vector storage
- Sufficient storage for document processing

### Installation Process

1. First, clone the repository and set up your Python environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hireable/trademarkpredictor.git
   cd trademarkpredictor
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure your environment by creating a `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   # Vector Store Configuration
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=eu-west-1
   
   # AI Service Configuration
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=europe-west2
   
   # Processing Configuration
   SCHEMA_PATH=data/schema.json
   EXAMPLES_PATH=data/examples.json
   ```

3. Set up your data directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data/raw_pdfs data/processed logs
   ```

## Using TrademarkPredictor

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of processing a trademark document:

```python
from src.agent import TrademarkCaseAgent
from src.config import ProcessingConfig

async def process_trademark_document():
    # Initialize with custom configuration
    config = ProcessingConfig(
        chunk_size=1500,
        chunk_overlap=150,
        batch_size=5
    )
    
    agent = TrademarkCaseAgent(processing_config=config)
    
    try:
        # Process a document with automatic namespace generation
        await agent.process_pdf_streaming(
            "path/to/document.pdf",
            namespace="trademark_case_001"
        )
    finally:
        # Ensure proper resource cleanup
        await agent.cleanup()
```

### Advanced Features

#### Custom Processing Pipelines

You can create specialized processing pipelines for different document types:

```python
async def custom_trademark_pipeline(document_path: str):
    agent = TrademarkCaseAgent()
    
    # Define custom processing stages
    async with agent:
        # Process document
        doc_vectors = await agent.process_pdf_streaming(document_path)
        
        # Search for similar cases
        similar_cases = await agent.find_similar_cases(
            doc_vectors,
            top_k=5,
            filter_criteria={
                "jurisdiction": "EU",
                "decision_year": 2023
            }
        )
        
        # Generate insights
        insights = await agent.generate_case_insights(
            doc_vectors,
            similar_cases
        )
        
        return insights
```

#### Batch Processing

For processing multiple documents efficiently:

```python
async def batch_process_documents(document_paths: List[str]):
    agent = TrademarkCaseAgent()
    
    async with agent:
        tasks = [
            agent.process_pdf_streaming(path)
            for path in document_paths
        ]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        
        return results
```
